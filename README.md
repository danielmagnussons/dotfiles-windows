## Wait, what dotfiles for windows?
Yes,  works pretty nicely with [MSysGit](http://msysgit.github.io/),  not many commands have been ported, but many common ones.

## How?
```
git clone https://github.com/danielmagnussons/dotfiles-windows.git
mv dotfiles-windows/*.* ~/
mv dotfiles-windows/* ~/
mv dotfiles-windows/.* ~/
```

## Todo
- [ ] mklink files instead of mv
- [ ] document everything...
- [ ] Sublime settings?
- [ ] more windows specific stuff
